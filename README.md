Attempting to understand the skyviper v2400 hd streaming drone by skyrocket toys

If you are interested in hacking, reverse engineering, automating, or understanding this drone and/or 
have any information that may assist in these endevours please submit a pull request or contact 
me via email and I will include it here.

to get started the viper file contains general info and assumptions.
Then the Serial_output_skyViper_controller contains debug from the controller.

unfortuantley i was unable to obtain any serial output from the drone itself.

happy hacking!
